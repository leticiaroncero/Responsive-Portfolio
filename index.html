                I'm a Community Manager living in San Francisco, California. I have a degree in Journalism from the
                Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), Spain.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer currently enrolled at the Coding Bootcamp at UC Berkeley
                Extension.
                I chose this new career because I have a passion for all things creative and like to build things and
                invent solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I moved out to San Francisco in January of 2014 to complete a Certificate Program in Marketing and take
                a position with Flickr, as part of their Community Team. This was a great opportunity to interact with a
                vast audience, and partner with our product, marketing, support, and engineering teams to identify and
                test ways of cultivating community on Flickr.
            </p>

            <p>
                My goal is to become a developer, build my own projects, and understand and communicate better with
                other developers in today's ever-changing working environment.
